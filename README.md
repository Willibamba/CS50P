### [Final Project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/project/)
##### Project: 
* A program to test the user on Mathematics, randomly generating ten equations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and diviion) for the user to solve and then output the total score out of ten.
* First, it prompt's the user for an input of level 1, 2, or 3.
* Then re-prompt the user with an equation to solve, when the user answer answer correctly then it proceeds to re-prompt again with another equation, or if the user's answer is wrong it print's the correct and continue to re-prompt the user with another equation till it reaches a total number ten equations.
* And finally, output user's the total score out of ten.
